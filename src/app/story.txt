Taking on a new challenge is always fun at the beginning. However, even with a project
as simple as a personal website, challenges come with unforeseen events and obstacles. It
becomes more difficult than originally expected. This website took me weeks to complete (and
is even edited months later) when I originally sat down with a friend and expected to finish it in a
few hours. We easily could have used a template, but the inherent personalization aspect of
building it yourself, and learning Tailwind CSS for the first time was an opportunity we did not
want to pass up. The beauty of this challenge is that I learned new tricks and skills, and more
importantly, I was led to my true reason for building the site in the first place.

Throughout my life, I have been exceptionally good at making friends. I get along well
with strangers, colleagues, and classmates, and the friends I do make are often friends for life. It
truly is a blessing. However, I was worried when I began applying for jobs. I realized that I would
not have the opportunity to strike a connection with the interviewer if I never made it to the
interview. I became frustrated when editing my resume because I wanted to add many more
elements that would never fit onto one page. Building a website, I thought, would be an
excellent and professional way to stand out as a candidate and would allow me to showcase all
my accomplishments. Before completion, I realized I had far less professionally acceptable
accolades than previously thought, but it was nice not to be limited to such a confined space.

Yet, this website was not just to stand out as a model job candidate either. And why
would it be? Upon creating this website, I had already accepted a job at one of the most
prestigious accounting firms in the world, so job placement could not have been my main
motivation. And please note, this website is certainly not to brag or boast either; I wince at every
self-promoting article I choose to put on here. No, the reason for creating this is that I am now in
the world of accounting, and I want to make a difference. That feeling, for me, will never go
away. Every place I have been, every team I have participated in, every group, and every day, I
strive to make changes â€“ to improve what can be improved. So, when I said I am good at
making friends, that was not to flex. I am trying to show that I can often make lasting, positive
first impressions when I meet people in person (so, yes, I urge you to reserve all judgment until
we meet face-to-face), and my hope is that by creating a website that showcases so many
different sides of me, your first impression may be more positive than had you only seen me
resume or LinkedIn. Maybe unique at the very least.

As I progress from college and graduate school into the professional world, my
dissatisfaction with complacency will only become more prevalent. I am aware of so many
problems in the world of accounting, in the United States and worldwide, and I am willing to help
in any way I can. I am always eager to get to know new people and to take on new risks and
challenges. I built this website because I wanted to show that I am capable, adventurous, and
willing to take action even in the face of judgment from peers. If I can be of assistance, please
reach out; I would be elated to meet you.
