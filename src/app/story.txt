The website serves multiple purposes. Most importantly, creating it was a challenge I felt compelled to undertake. One of the most important life lessons is to listen to your heart. Like any challenge, this came with unexpected hiccups and unforeseen obstacles. This took me weeks to finish and is continuously edited, when I originally planned to complete it in a matter of hours. I easily could have used a template, but the inherent personalization aspect of building it yourself and learning Tailwind CSS for the first time was an opportunity I did not want to pass up.

This website also serves as an extended resume. I always felt too confined in trying to sum up my entire life in a single page for a resume. Similarly, any natural charisma and personal connection are completely forfeited when using a resume. I hate being rejected for jobs before I even get to the interview. This website is no substitute for an in-person first impression, but I hope it makes me more than a number on a screen.

I also used this to showcase my coding skills and connect with people. I know I am a novice, but the ability to take my own design ideas and implement those into a functional website was a milestone for me. I was sure to add features for those reading the website to connect with me. If you are someone who might want to talk with me I am happy to talk or provide any services free of charge, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out.

I hope you enjoy the website. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
