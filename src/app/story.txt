  The website serves multiple purposes. Most importantly, creating it was a challenge I felt compelled to undertake. One of the most important life lessons is to listen to your heart. Like any challenge, this came with unexpected hiccups and unforeseen obstacles. This took me weeks to finish and is continuously edited, when I originally planned to complete it in a matter of hours. I easily could have used a template, but the inherent personalization aspect of building it yourself and learning Tailwind CSS for the first time was an opportunity I did not want to pass up.

  This website also serves as an extended resume. I always felt too confined in trying to sum up my entire life in a single page for a resume. Similarly, any natural charisma and personal connection are completely forfeited when using a resume. I hate being rejected for jobs before I even get to the interview. This website is no substitute for an in-person first impression, but I hope it makes me more than a number on a screen.

  I will also use this website as an outlet for helping other people, which has always been a passion of mine. Giving free happiness to others and learning new things while doing it brings one a special kind of satisfaction. I listed my largest skill sets in the Services section above, but if there is anything you want me to help with, or even if you just want to have a conversation, I am more than willing to join you. 

  I currently work a full-time role as an international tax consultant at a prestigious firm. I thoroughly enjoy my work, and I could not be happier with my employer. I have developed excellent time management skills after a lifetime of being a student-athlete, though, and I do not like to sit idle in my free time. If we sit and chat there is a chance it amounts to nothing, a chance we work together for a short period, and a chance that we create something special. If you have any questions or requests for me, donâ€™t hesitate to fill out the form below. Thank you!
